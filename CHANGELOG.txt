# v2.0.1
- Rewrite error handling
- Update `change_query` function to get ActionKeyword from `plugin.json`
- Add autocomplete/spellcheck for words that aren't found to check for possible misspellings (can be turned off in settings due to it being kind of slow).
    - Make `word_list.txt` not automatically download incase of the use of a custom word list, or not using the feature at all to use less storage.
    - Support for custom word lists.
- Add search modifier selector
    - Invalid search modifier error now points to this
- Add parts of speech selector
- Remove canonical option due to it not doing anything
- Fix bug with some queries returning errors due to the plugin attempting to log unicode characters with the wrong encoding.
